## Submission

### Overview
The  dashboard viewed in [index.html](https://github.com/JaredTMurray/plotlydiploy/blob/main/index.html) holds the demographic information that visualize the bacterial data infomration from sample.json file. The charts identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. JavaScript [chart.js](https://github.com/JaredTMurray/plotlydiploy/blob/main/chart.js) holds the function that produces the charts in the following results.

Varibale barData holds the sample array vaules from names values. Varibles y-value, xValue and textlabel holds the vaule for otu_ids, otu_labels, and sample_values that were used to plot the bar chart. I sort the values by n descending order. To create the layout for the bar chart that includes a title. I used . See images below to view bar chart.
